# NYC-SAT-Score-Analysis

This repo contains source files and code analysing SAT scores by zip code and demographics in New York City. The goal of this project is to determine if the correlation between SAT scores and income still exists in NYC, given the concentration of high scorers in a small number of neighborhoods that are not necessarily where students live.

This data came from the College Board and NYC Open Data.
